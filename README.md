## Prerequisites
* Generalized Adsorption Simulator for Python ([GASpy](https://github.com/ulissigroup/GASpy))

* Additional packages required for gaspy enviroment:
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org)

## Usage

### Example

"Example" Jupyter notebook demonstrates how we trained the model and used for binding energy prediction. ('Example.ipynb')

### Make figure

Located in the 'notebooks' folder

We have included Jupyter notebooks used to make figures, such as histogram.

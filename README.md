- [pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org) (2021.3.3)

## Usage

### Example

"Example" Jupyter notebook demonstrates how we trained the model and used for binding energy prediction. ('Example.ipynb')

### Make figure

Located in the 'notebooks' folder

We have included Jupyter notebooks used to make figures, such as histogram.
